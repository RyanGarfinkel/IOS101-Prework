**App Idea** <br>
I currently use the Notes app on my phone to log my workouts. While it's simple and helps me keep track of what I've done, I'd like to build an app that better visualizes my progression for each workout. In addition to logging custom workouts, I want to include a feature that charts the user's progress over time -- an easy way to see improvement. I also think adding a quote of the day feature would be motivational and improve the workout experience. The goal of this app is to be lightweight, easy to use, and to provide meaningful feedback to the user.

## Notes

This was the first time I've used XCode. It took some time to get familar with the IDE and understand where the important panels were. It was initaly confusing to add the UI elements and connect the logic, but the Building Application steps cleared this up for me.
